      <h2>All About Ashe</h2>
      <main>
         <p>Hello! I'm Ashe Gravenkemper, and I've recently relocated to Dallas to begin my college journey. In addition to my studies, I work as a senior technician at a local gaming company, where I apply my technical expertise in the gaming industry. I've also completed the Harvard CS50 Web Design program, which solidified my passion for web development.</p>
         
         <p>As I continue to grow in this field, my goal is to transition into a career as web developer, creating dynamic, user-centered websites. I'm excited about the opportunities that web development presents, and I'm eager to expand my skills while making an impact through creative and functional design.</p>
