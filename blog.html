            <h3>First steps of web development</h3>
            <p>The article "Website Development Process: A Step-by-Step Guide" outlines a comprehensive approach to building effective websites through eight key stages. The process begins with the Discovery phase, involving in-depth research and collaboration to define the project's scope, feature requirements, stakeholders, and expectations. This foundational step ensures all team members are aligned before progressing. Next is Information Architecture, where the site's structure and content hierarchy are planned to optimize user experience and search engine visibility. This stage often includes creating visual sitemaps to map out content placement and navigation.</p>
            <h3>Pre-development planning</h3>
            <p>Following the architectural planning, the process moves to Wireframes and Design. Wireframes serve as blueprints, detailing page layouts and functionalities without visual design elements, focusing purely on structure. Once approved, the Design phase adds visual aesthetics, incorporating branding elements to create an engaging user interface. Concurrently, the Content phase involves developing and organizing textual and multimedia elements, ensuring they align with the site's goals and resonate with the target audience.</p>

            <h3>Google's approach on AI</h3>
            <p>On October 18, 2024, Google hosted its inaugural Web AI Summit, uniting leading experts in client-side machine learning within web browsers. This approach enables AI models to operate entirely offline after the initial page load, offering benefits like low-latency inference, reduced costs, and enhanced user privacy. The summit featured presentations from Googles Chrome and MediaPipe teams, as well as contributions from industry leaders such as Intel, Hugging Face, Microsoft, and LangChain.</p>
            <h3>State of AI</h3>
            <p>Keynote speakers, including Jason Mayes, Google's Web AI Lead, and Jim Bankoski, VP of Engineering for Chrome, provided insights into the current state and future direction of Web AI. They discussed the potential of on-device machine learning and the motivations behind organizing the summit. The event also showcased various applications of client-side AI, highlighting the growing importance of integrating machine learning capabilities directly into web browsers to improve user experiences.</p>
            <h3>AI applications</h3>
            <p>The summit underscored the significance of client-side AI in advancing web technologies, emphasizing the role of on-device processing in achieving efficient and privacy-preserving AI applications. By bringing together experts from diverse organizations, the event fostered collaboration and knowledge sharing, paving the way for future innovations in Web AI.
