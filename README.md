# Web Authoring Weekly Project - Test.html

## Project Overview
This project is part of the Web Authoring course where students complete weekly assignments and upload their work to GitHub repositories. The goal of this assignment is to give students hands-on experience in web development and testing. The project will help students practice HTML markup and ensure they can view their assignments in a browser as they would appear to the public.

## Assignment Details
- **Objective:** Create a simple HTML page about yourself using the provided instructions.
- **Technologies Used:** HTML (no CSS, images, or JavaScript except what is required in the instructions).
- **File:** `test.html`
  
## Purpose of the Project
The main purpose of this project is to help students become familiar with web authoring concepts, including:
1. Structuring an HTML page.
2. Testing a live version of the page online through GitHub and the browser.
3. Presenting themselves through a basic web page, while maintaining focus on clean and functional code.

## About Me
My name is Ashe Gravenkemper, and I’m currently taking this Web Authoring class as part of my journey to becoming a solo web developer. I’m excited to expand my skills and knowledge in web development and to continue building a solid foundation for future projects.

## Project Files
- **test.html:** Contains the HTML code for the page about me.

## How to View
To view the page, clone or download this repository and open the `test.html` file in a web browser. You will be able to see how it appears to the public, simulating the real-world experience of posting content online.

## Conclusion
This project marks an important step in mastering the process of web development, particularly in creating a simple yet functional web page. I look forward to continuing to refine my web development skills throughout the course.
