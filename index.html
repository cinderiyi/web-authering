      <h2>All About Ashe</h2>
      <main>
         <p>Hello! I'm Ashe Gravenkemper, and I've recently relocated to Dallas to begin my college journey. In addition to my studies, I work as a senior technician at a local gaming company, where I apply my technical expertise in the gaming industry. I've also completed the Harvard CS50 Web Design program, which solidified my passion for web development.</p>
         
         <p>As I continue to grow in this field, my goal is to transition into a career as web developer, creating dynamic, user-centered websites. I'm excited about the opportunities that web development presents, and I'm eager to expand my skills while making an impact through creative and functional design.</p>

         <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
         <p>One of my biggest passions is <em>playing the bass.</em> There's something about the deep, resonant tones that really speaks to me, and I love how the instrument lays the foundation for a song. Whether I'm jamming alone or playing with others, bass has become an essential part of how I express myself. I'm always looking to improve my technique, learn new riffs, and experiment with different genres, but punk music holds a special place in my heart.</p>

         <p>Another creative outlet of mine is <em>hair dyeing and coloring.</em> I find it incredibly rewarding to help people transform their look with bold and vibrant colors. Whether it's a friend wanting a whole new style or someone just looking for a small change, I love the artistic aspect of mixing shades and creating something unique. It's a form of self-expression, and seeing someone's confidence boost after a fresh color job is always exciting.</p>

         <p>When I'm not out at shows or working on hair, I like to unwind with <em>League of Legends.</em> Whether I'm grinding ranked matches or just playing casually with friends, I enjoy the strategy and teamwork that goes into the game. It's a great way to connect with people, and there's always something new to learn or master.</p>

         <p>Another big interest of mine is <em>urbexâ€”urban exploration.</em> There's something thrilling about discovering abandoned places and seeing the history left behind. Whether it's an old factory, a forgotten house, or a hidden tunnel, every place has a story to tell. I enjoy capturing the eerie beauty of these locations through photos and taking in the quiet atmosphere of places most people don't get to see.</p>

         <p>At the core of all these interests is my love for <em>making new connections with people.</em> Whether it's through music, gaming, or shared experiences, I always enjoy meeting people who share my passions or introduce me to new ones. Life is all about experiences, and I'm always looking for new ways to explore and grow.</p>
